# To use the AI/ML metadata extraction API
start by installing the necessary Python dependencies, including fastapi, uvicorn, transformers, python-docx, pytesseract, and Pillow. Once installed, launch the API using uvicorn by running the command uvicorn app:app --reload in your terminal (or within Jupyter Notebook using nest_asyncio). The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000. To test and interact with the API, open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, which provides a Swagger UI for uploading .docx or .png files. Simply click on the /extract/ endpoint, select “Try it out,” upload your file, and hit “Execute” to receive structured metadata such as Agreement Value, Start and End Dates, Renewal Notice Days, Party One, and Party Two. You can also interact with the API programmatically by sending a POST request to the /extract/ endpoint with your file using tools like Python’s requests library or Postman. The API will respond with a JSON object containing the extracted answers.
